    <h2>There are 5 Courses in this Specialization</h2>

    <section>
      <h2>Course One: The Craft of Plot</h2>
      <p>
        In this course aspiring writers will be introduced to perhaps the most
        elemental and often the most challenging element of story: plot. We will
        learn what keeps it moving, how it manipulates our feelings,
        expectations, and desires. We will examine the choices storytellers make
        to snag our imaginations, drag them into a fictional world, and keep
        them there. We will learn how to outline and structure a plot, discuss
        narrative arc, pacing and reversals and reveal the inevitable surprise:
        connecting the beginning, middle and end.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Course Two: The Craft of Character</h2>
      <p>
        At the center of a good story are the characters in it. In this course
        aspiring writers will discover how to build and bring to life complex,
        vivid and unforgettable characters. We will study the choices a writer
        makes to bring all characters to life on the page, and we will perform
        written exercises in order to develop a variety of writing and
        pre-writing techniques, in order to create a variety of characters. We
        will learn how to use our own life experiences, and the people we know
        (and how not to!). We will develop inner (thoughts and feelings) and
        outer (appearance, habits, behavior) lives for our characters and see
        how that can lead us to richer and more interesting stories. We will
        breathe life into our characters and let them surprise us.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Course Three: The Craft of Setting and Description</h2>
      <p>
        In this course aspiring writers will be introduced to the techniques
        that masters of fiction use to ground a story in a concrete world. From
        the most realist settings to the most fantastical, writers will learn
        how to describe the physical world in sharp, sensory detail. We will
        also learn how to build credibility through research, and to use
        creative meditation exercises to deepen our own understanding of our
        story worlds, so that our readers can see all that we imagine.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Course Fore: The Craft of Style</h2>
      <p>
        Your style is as unique and distinctive as your face, your voice, except
        that you can choose it, you can can work on it, enhance it. In this
        course we will introduce aspiring writers to the art of putting pressure
        on written language. We will study the use of metaphor and imagery, and
        demonstrate how clarity, grace, and inventiveness in word choice are
        imperative to a story’s success. Writers will emerge with the revision
        skills essential to all writers of good stories and good prose.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Course Five: Your Story</h2>
      <p>
        Everything comes together in the Capstone. You will draft a complete
        story, narrative essay, or memoir of 8–15 pages. With the advice of your
        peer readers, you will revise, rewrite, and complete it. The skills
        you’ve learned of plotting, setting, physical description,
        characterization, and stylistic clarity and innovation will culminate in
        an original work of art all your own. We’ll discuss the steps that
        professional writers take to bring their work into the public world.
        Along the way you’ll learn the patient habits of revision that make up
        the writer’s life.

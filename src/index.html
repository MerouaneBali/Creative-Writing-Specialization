        This specialization covers elements of three major creative writing
        genres: short story, narrative essay, and memoir.
      </h2>
      <p>
        You will master the techniques that good writers use to compose a
        bracing story, populated with memorable characters in an interesting
        setting, written in a fresh descriptive style. You will analyze and
        constructively evaluate peer writing. In the Capstone, you will draft,
        rewrite, and complete a substantial original story in the genre of your
        choosing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our courses are designed for anyone from the aspiring short story writer
        to established novelist. Whether you have a finished novel sitting on
        your desk calling for a fresh look or have had the germ of an idea for a
        decade, this Specialization gives you tools to achieve your goal.
        Through 4 courses focused on a key aspect of writing, and taken in any
        order you choose, you will develop a stronger ability to not only refine
        your writing, but critique writing in general and find inspiration in
        the works you are already reading.

      <h2>How the Specialization Works</h2>
      <p>
        Take Courses: A Coursera Specialization is a series of courses that
        helps you master a skill. To begin, enroll in the Specialization
        directly, or review its courses and choose the one you'd like to start
        with. When you subscribe to a course that is part of a Specialization,
        you’re automatically subscribed to the full Specialization. It’s okay to
        complete just one course — you can pause your learning or end your
        subscription at any time. Visit your learner dashboard to track your
        course enrollments and your progress.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hands-on Project: Every Specialization includes a hands-on project.
        You'll need to successfully finish the project(s) to complete the
        Specialization and earn your certificate. If the Specialization includes
        a separate course for the hands-on project, you'll need to finish each
        of the other courses before you can start it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Earn a Certificate: When you finish every course and complete the
        hands-on project, you'll earn a Certificate that you can share with
        prospective employers and your professional network.
